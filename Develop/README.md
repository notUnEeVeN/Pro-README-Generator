# Professional README Generator

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This is the project for the 9th module of my UCB Coding Bootcamp. For this project we were given bits of starter JavaScript code for a professional readme generator and told to complete it. We have node and the inquirer version 8.2.4 package to create code that will prompt the user in the terminal for the details they want to include in their readme, and then write a file that fits the standard formatting conventions of readme using that data.

## Installation

The user needs to have node installed, as well as run the npm i inquirer@8.2.4 function in their terminal as those large modules are hidden in the github repository using git ignore. Those two steps are necessary to properly execute the application in your terminal.

## Usage 

Once all the files are properly installed simply run the JavaScript file using node (e.g node index) and then fill the prompts with your desired information.
